# What is this

For the purpose of doing some golang for fun this is a clone of "jq" implemented in go.

It is far from complete but can parse some basic json files atm and pretty print them.

Please do not use for anything but testing

example usage. "cat test.json | jsonpretty"

Have only implemented reading input from pipe, might do file at some point.
As i said this is only a test project
